                  My name is Mafa Maketela, as of 2022 I am doing my final year
                  in computer science.

                  In order to kick-start my career before I graduate, I am
                  looking for a job or internship of a android or web developer,
                  since that is what I have been doing already for a year in my
                  free time.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Designing and developing simple android apps and websites,
                  with the help of some open source content-management systems,
                  and so on. Besides that I am a normal guy who enjoys hiking
                  and spending time with friends, while not working or studying,
                  which takes most of my time of course. If I should pick the
                  best website I have designed up to this point, it will be this
                  one open, and incase of android application, they are
                  displayed in portfolio section. I am ambitious and
                  hard-working and believe you will give me a chance to prove my
                  words.
